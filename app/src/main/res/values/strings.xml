This application was developed by Raymetrics S.A., within the framework of the Operational
Program of the Region of Central Macedonia 2014-2020 &quot;RESEARCH INNOVATION PROJECTS&quot; with
the project title &quot; Development of a forecasting system and geographical indicators for the
agriculture.&quot;, PSKE CODE: KMP6- 0078047.
    </string>

    <string name="description_info">
 Meteoray is an integrated agricultural information system based on operational weather
forecasting with high spatial resolution (1km x1km), specifically adapted to the needs of the
producer and to the climatic and topographical characteristics of the region, with an emphasis on
conditions of frost and increased humidity. The system aims to aid the producers with specialized
indicators, in making day-to-day decisions that are fundamentally affected by weather conditions
such as crop growth/irrigation, fertilization, pest and disease control, and fieldwork capability.
The application enables immediate information on the weather forecast and geographical
indicators in locations of the user  &quot; s choice as well as the issuance of relevant warnings for the
protection and optimization of production.
